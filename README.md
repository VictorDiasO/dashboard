# Admin Dashboard for Newsletter Business Owners

It's basically a Admin Dashboard with some CSS animations and really cool features, that I'll improve when have time.
I started to learn about this site just for understand more about:
- TailwindCSS;
- CSS;
- Responsibility;
- ReactJS;
- Kanban Model;
- Calendar Logic;

And I've really learned good things from here.

## Try it right now!!
- https://dashboard-one-beryl.vercel.app/

You can access the site above to try the application. Now Im using just a context to save the changes, so nothing here will be saved.

## Screenshots
- Here you'll find a big resume of the news in your "Newsletter Business".

- In that Kanban you can see what your team are doing, what news they're looking and thinking to write down in your newsletter.

- In this calendar you can do the plan of meetings and tasks for the employees or for you, but all the "admin" people can access your plans.

Im on the journey to learn more about CSS, I always want to be a Full-Stack, but the CSS is a good challenge for me.
Im starting now and I create a "Week challenge", every week I will see a youtube tutorial to help me, and then I will re-write the site to create something like a SaaS system or whatever that seems like a Real Product.

## My next steps are:
- More about CSS;
- More about TailwindCSS;
- More about ReactJS;
- TypeScript;
- Automaated Tests in ReactJS websites;

The future of this project:
- I'll build a "Real Product" from this repository, with Login system using 0Auth, with a PostgreSQL database using the Prisma.

Next features:
 - [X] Create the basic of the site and learn about CSS.
 - [ ] PostgreSQL Database with Prisma.
 - [ ] Login System.
 - [ ] Add more functions focused on Newsletters owners.
